# PauseMe

PauseMe is a breath guide Web Application that I built when I started to learn Design Systems and Responsive.
This project allowed me to implement the knowledge about user-friendly designs and, also, continue revisiting most of the EcmaScript6+ features.
The next move on this project is to expand the possibilities and create a ReactJS PauseMe, where it can be a scalable and upgraded application.
