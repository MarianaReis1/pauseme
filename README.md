# pauseme-js

PauseMe is a breath guide webapp. It has a friendly and simple UX Design and was built with Vanilla JS, Sass and BEM. 

PauseMe idea came when I was starting to learn Vanilla JavaScrip, Responsiveness and Design Concepts, so I decided to build something where I could practice these new abilities and use the application regurlarly.

Now we are vuilding the second fase of this project: a version on ReactJS App, so we can better manage the view and have the databased managed with NodeJs. The main focus will be to grown the application and expend the possibilities, such as include new scenes from the ux side, having the option to turn off the breath guide and only keep the video and so on.
